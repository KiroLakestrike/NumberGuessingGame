# NumberGuessingGame

A small Project to get used to Go

## How to Play

All the Instructions are on Screen. While you play.

I will try to catch as many human input errors. As this is part of the learning process.

1 Select a Difficulty between 1, 2 and 3
1.1 Difficulty 1, guess a Number between 1 and 10, you have 5 guesses.

1.2 Difficulty 2, Guess a Number between 1 and 25, you have 5 guesses.

1.3 Difficulty 2, Guess a Number between 1 and 50, you have 5 guesses.

After each guess, the game will give you a hint, if the number you typed is higher or lower.
